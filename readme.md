## SNON Utilities

A series of C routines for use in embedded systems that implement basic [SNON](https://www.snon.org/) functionality, including:

- Registering SNON entities
- Updating SNON entities
- Handling time when no RTC

These routines use the [cJSON](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON/tree/master) library.
